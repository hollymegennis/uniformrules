    <p>Don’t you just hate when a teacher pulls you over in the hallways to tell you to tie your hair up or to take the second piercing out or even to take your puffer jacket off. I think to myself, “how does that effect my education?” </p>
        
    <p> think that having a school uniform is good. I like having a uniform because it saves time in the morning when getting ready and no one can make fun of what you’re wearing because you are all wearing the same thing and you have less washing at the end of the week. </p>
        
    <p> However, I think that the school uniform rules are way too strict. For example, black and brown hair ties only, no ticks on your socks, no necklaces or bracelets. I think that is ridiculous and a bit over the top.</p>
